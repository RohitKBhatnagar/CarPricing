The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

    "\n",
    "- Which characteristics (e.g., brand, age, mileage, fuel type, transmission) most strongly influence price?\n",
    "- Which combinations of features tend to command a premium?\n",
    "- Where are the biggest discounts or price penalties (e.g., high mileage, older cars, certain brands or trims)?\n",

    "*Because the dataset contains substantial missing values and some unrealistic entries (e.g., extreme prices, odometer readings, and years), part of the technical challenge will involve cleaning and filtering the data before modeling. Many categorical variables such as manufacturer, model, condition, cylinders, and drive have missingness ranging from 20% to 70%, so we will need to decide whether to impute, simplify, or drop certain features.*\n",

Linear and regularized regression models will allow us to quantify how each feature (e.g., mileage, age, brand, transmission) affects price while still producing actionable insights.*"
